CAS Management
===
**Please note that this repo is no longer maintained and is succeeded by the repo
in WildCAS link: https://github.com/WildCAS/CASCategorization. If you would like to help out, please send a PR to that repo, thanks!**

**Quick technical notes: This app was in the transition to adopt AngularJS, but the project was never completed, so you may encounter many bugs along the way. The succeeding project will continue to use Django, but will instead be employing ReactJS as frontend.**

**Hello and welcome!**

### What is iU?

iU is an app written by a group of IB alumni with an interest for helping IB
students manage their CAS portfolios easier.

You should (**soon**) expect to find an app that has a full fledged Student and Coordinator interface that allows for Students to efficiently add and/or modify their CAS entries.

We aim to have one of the best user interfaces and flows so that Students can focus their efforts on producing the most thoughtful reflections and Coordinators can focus on providing the best guidance to their Students.

### Installing

Please see our [wiki](https://github.com/kevinlee12/iU/wiki/Installing-the-Project-Locally) for details on installing the project.

### Current implementation notes:
- Runs on Python 3
- Deployed on Heroku with Cloudinary as the image storage
