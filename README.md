**Hello and welcome!**

### What is iU?

iU is an app written by a group of IB alumni with an interest for helping IB
students manage their CAS portfolios easier.

You should (**soon**) expect to find an app that has a full fledged Student and Coordinator interface that allows for Students to efficiently add and/or modify their CAS entries.

We aim to have one of the best user interfaces and flows so that Students can focus their efforts on producing the most thoughtful reflections and Coordinators can focus on providing the best guidance to their Students.
